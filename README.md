#  Car Price Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing car price data and building a machine learning model
to understand the factors affecting car prices and predict the MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price).

---

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is:
- To perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on car data
- To visualize the relationship between different categorical features and MSRP
- To train a machine learning model for **car price prediction**

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to visualize how different categorical variables
impact the car price (MSRP).

# Model Used The project uses Linear Regression
 **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`) - 
 **Target Variable**: MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) - 
 **Features**: Horsepower, Torque, Make, Body Size, Body Style, Engine Aspiration, Drivetrain, Transmission (after one-hot encoding) -
